 * {@link hunt.stomp.simp.user.UserDestinationResolver
 * UserDestinationResolver}.
 *
 * <p>Generally it is expected the user is the one authenticated with the
 * WebSocket session (or by extension the user authenticated with the
 * handshake request that started the session). However if the session is
 * not authenticated, it is also possible to pass the session id (if known)
 * in place of the user name. Keep in mind though that in that scenario,
 * you must use one of the overloaded methods that accept headers making sure the
 * {@link hunt.stomp.simp.SimpMessageHeaderAccessor#setSessionId
 * sessionId} header has been set accordingly.

	 * message leaves the application, the provided headers are included with it
	 * and delivered to the destination (e.g. the STOMP client or broker).

	 * {@link hunt.stomp.simp.SimpMessageHeaderAccessor SimpMessageHeaderAccessor}
	 * then the headers are used directly. A common expected case is providing a
	 * content type (to influence the message conversion) and native headers.
	 * This may be done as follows:
	 * <pre class="code">
	 * SimpMessageHeaderAccessor accessor = SimpMessageHeaderAccessor.create();
	 * accessor.setContentType(MimeTypeUtils.TEXT_PLAIN);
	 * accessor.setNativeHeader("foo", "bar");
	 * accessor.setLeaveMutable(true);

	 * messagingTemplate.convertAndSendToUser(user, destination, payload, headers);

	 * the above example, implementations of this interface should take notice and
	 * update the headers in the same instance (rather than copy or re-create it)
	 * and then set it immutable before sending the final message.
	 * @param user the user that should receive the message (must not be {@code null})
